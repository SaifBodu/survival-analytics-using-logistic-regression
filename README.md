# Survival Analytics using Logistic Regression

This repository contains an implementation of survival analytics using logistic regression in Python. Survival analytics is a statistical approach to modeling the time until an event of interest occurs, such as customer churn, disease diagnosis, or equipment failure. In this project, we use logistic regression to analyze and predict survival outcomes.

## Features

- Survival analysis using logistic regression.
- Support for both time-to-event and event-censoring data.
- Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed examples and explanations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
